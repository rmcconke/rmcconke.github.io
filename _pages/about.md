Ryley graduated from the University of Alberta in 2019 with a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering (co-op). Pursing an interest in turbulence and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), Ryley then began his Master's degree at the University of Waterloo. In his Master's research, Ryley focused on simulating a new type of wind turbine, which uses vortex induced vibration (VIV) to generate energy. Ryley direct transferred to a PhD in 2020, focusing on developing new turbulence models using machine learning techniques. Ryley completed a 6 month visit at the University of Manchester in 2022-2023, where he focused on data-driven turbulence modelling on complex 3D flows.

Ryley has uniquely diverse experience that includes mechanical design, software implementation, and industrial research and development. At [MACH32](https://www.mach32.net/), a medical device startup company, Ryley designed and simulated novel autoinjectors and COVID-19 protection devices. He is a co-author of multiple patents for these designs. Ryley also has worked on automating CFD simulations as a Software Developer at [Orbital Stack](https://orbitalstack.com/), a wind engineering startup company. In the Research and Development group (Labs) at [RWDI](https://rwdi.com/en_ca/), Ryley developed and implemented machine learning based tools to augment simulations and wind tunnel experiments.
